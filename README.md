To improve transparency and accountability 

If we have an app for all the complaints loaded,  to point out injustice and seek help  it would help us work and function more efficiently as a society. 


Everyone has access to the app. We can access all the public services like hospitals, police station , fire station etc through this app. 

Like we can go and lodge complaint,  book as service Like ambulance, or report injustice to people etc, and every case and it's status will be transparent ro public along with government. So that at any stage anyone can offer help or support 

Or question on any action pending from Government 

This would increase accessibility and transparency and also could help reduce negligence and corruption.
